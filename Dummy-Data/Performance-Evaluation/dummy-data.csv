1,"As similar as RDD transformations, there are same RDD actions available on spark pair RDD. However, paired RDDs also attains some additional actions of spark. Basically, those leverages the advantage of data which is of keyvalue nature.","As a result, we have learned to work with Spark key-value data. Moreover, we have also learned how to create Spark Paired RDD and how to use the specialized Spark functions and operations. However, we hope this article answered all your questions regarding same. Still, if you feel to ask any query, feel free to ask in the comment section."
2,"In Apache Spark, key-value pairs are what we call as paired RDD. This Spark Paired RDD tutorial aims the information on what are paired RDDs in Spark. We will also learn following methods of creating spark paired RDD and operations on paired RDDs in spark. Such as transformations and actions in Spark RDD. Here transformation operations are groupByKey, reduceByKey, join, left outer join/right OuterJoin. Whereas actions like countByKey.","Apache Spark’s Core abstraction is Resilient Distributed Datasets, an acronym for Resilient Distributed Datasets is RDD. Also, a fundamental data structure of Spark. Moreover, Spark RDDs is immutable in nature. As well as the distributed collection of objects. Basically, RDD in spark is designed as each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions. Further, we can say here each partition may be computed on different nodes of the cluster. Moreover, Spark RDDs contain user-defined classes."
3,"Spark Paired RDDs are nothing but RDDs containing a key-value pair. Basically, key-value pair (KVP) consists of a two linked data item in it. Here, the key is the identifier, whereas value is the data corresponding to the key value.","Moreover, Spark operations work on RDDs containing any type of objects. However key-value pair RDDs attains few special operations in it. Such as, distributed “shuffle” operations, grouping or aggregating the elements by a key."
4,I have seen a movie called Jigsaw. It is really amazing. The way they are killed is simply superb. I want to watch the movie again.,On the other day I was watching jigsaw movie. What an amazing movie! They are killed again and again. Now simply sleep.
